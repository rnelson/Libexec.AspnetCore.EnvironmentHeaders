# EnvironmentHeaders Middleware

![Build status](https://github.com/rnelson/Libexec.AspnetCore.EnvironmentHeaders/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

The EnvironmentHeaders middleware is a small ASP.NET Core middleware package that adds [a few response headers](https://github.com/rnelson/Libexec.AspnetCore.EnvironmentHeaders/blob/main/Libexec.AspnetCore.EnvironmentHeaders/EnvironmentHeaders.cs#L14-L19) to every request to aid in troubleshooting.

It is recommended you not include this middleware in production.
